This research focuses on developing an AI-ML model that predicts the prices
 of agriculture- horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetables.
 Traditional methods fail to capture the volatility caused by market dynamics,
 climate condition, and supply demand fluctuations. The AI-ML model will
 incorporate multiple datasets including historical price data, weather
 patterns, crop yields, and global market trends to offer accurate price
 forecasts.
